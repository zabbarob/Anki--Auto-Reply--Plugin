DISCONTINUED - Needs Anki 1.2.8 and won't work with current Anki 2.x series.

Anki 'Auto Reply' Plugin

Title: Auto Reply
Tags: timer automation countdown attention pressure

9 seconds after showing the answer to the current card the default answer button is automatically pressed and the next question shown. 

The default answer button will be 2 for new cards and 3 for mature cards. Have a look at Anki's documentation - http://ankisrs.net/docs/manual.html#_answer_buttons 

You can use this plugin together with the "Auto Answer" plugin to repeat cards again and again without manually pressing a button. "Auto Answer" will set the default answer button to 1 "Again" if you do not press a button. 

You can configure the time span by opening the plugin file in a text editor and setting the value of secondsUntilReply to another amount of seconds (line 14 of the file).
